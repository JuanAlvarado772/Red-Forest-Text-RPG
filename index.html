On the rugged northern coast, where the relentless sea clashes with the sky, sits an ancient lighthouse. Once neglected, it has been reborn under Logan Hartwell and his family's care. They transformed it into a thriving farm, a symbol of resilience against the desolate landscape.

However, this idyllic existence is threatened when local authorities triple the taxes on their land, putting everything Logan has built at risk. Faced with the prospect of losing his family's home, Logan hears of a daring opportunity: hunters venturing into darkness to seek treasure and battle legendary beasts. Despite his family's history of farming, Logan is drawn to this perilous path as the only means to secure their future.

Embarking on a journey filled with unknown dangers, Logan's quest is more than a fight for survivalâ€”it's a struggle to maintain the legacy of the lighthouse, a beacon of hope and home. This tale of Logan Hartwell is one of courage, sacrifice, and the lengths one will go to protect their loved ones.
