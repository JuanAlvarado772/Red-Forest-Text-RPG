On the rugged northern coast, where the relentless sea clashes with the sky, the once proud lighthouse that Logan Hartwell and his family called home stands broken and neglected. Severe conditions have ravaged the land, leaving the lighthouse in ruins, and with it, the family's livelihood has crumbled away. Strapped for resources, Logan has been unable to repair the beacon of hope that once guided ships to safety.

The situation grows dire as the kingdom imposes a heavy late tax on the land. Logan faces an ultimatum: pay 5000 gold within the next month or watch as the authorities seize the property that has been in his family for generations. With no money to his name and the weight of the future pressing down on him, Logan learns of opportunities for adventure and treasure beyond the familiar shores.

Drawn to the promise of wealth and a chance to save his family's legacy, Logan is poised to venture into the unknown. This new path is fraught with peril, but the potential rewards offer the only glimmer of hope to restore the lighthouse and secure his family's home. This tale of Logan Hartwell is set to become one of courage, sacrifice, and the desperate measures one man will take to protect everything he holds dear.
